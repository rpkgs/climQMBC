\title{climQMBC example report}
\usage{
report(obs, mod, var, fun, y_init, y_wind)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{A column vector of monthly or annual observed data (temperature or precipitation). If monthly frequency is specified, the length of this vector is 12 times the number of observed years \link{12 x y_obs, 1}. If annual frequency is specified, the length of this vector is equal to the number of observed years \link{y_obs, 1}.}

\item{mod}{A column vector of monthly or annual modeled data (temperature or precipitation). If monthly frequency is specified, the length of this vector is 12 times the number of observed years \link{12 x y_mod, 1}. If annual frequency is specified, the length of this vector is equal to the number of observed years \link{y_mod, 1}.}

\item{var}{A flag that identifies if data are temperature or precipitation. This flag tells the getDist function if it has to discard distribution functions that allow negative numbers, and if the terms in the correction equations are multiplied/divided or added/subtracted. Temperature:   var = 0; Precipitation: var = 1}

\item{fun}{(Optional) A list of strings with the desired bias correction methods to be reported. If this input is not recieved by the function, all bias correction methods available in the climQMBC package will be reported. The methods supported are: a) 'QM' : Quantile Mapping; b) 'DQM': Detrended Quantile Mapping; c) 'QDM': Quantile Delta Mapping; d) 'UQM': Unbiased Quantile Mapping; Default: fun = \link{'QM','DQM','QDM','UQM','SDM'}}

\item{y_init}{(Optional) First year of the observed and modeled series (integer). Default: y_init = 0}

\item{y_wind}{(Optional) A list of integers with the year of the center of the projected periods to be reported. Default: y_wind = \link{int(y_obs+y_obs/2), int(y_mod-y_obs/2)} This value sets a first projected period just after the end of historical period, and a second projected period just before the end of the modeled series.}
}
\value{
A list with the five methods implemented in the climQMBC ppackage: QM, DQM, QDM, UQM, and SDM.
}
\description{
This function generates two report of the performance of the different methods (QM, DQM, QDM, UQM and SDM) available in the climQMBC package. These reports are based on the mean and standard deviation of the series in the historical and future projected periods.
}
\details{
The first report is a summary table with the overall performance of the QM method in the historical period and of the different methods in future projected periods. The methods performance is addressed by comparing its variations in the mean and standard deviation with the ones of the modeled data.

The second report consist of three figures. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of the observed, modeled, and corrected series in the historical and future period. This figure also shows the complete time series. Figure 2 and 3 shows the monthly mean and standard deviation, respectively, of each series in the historical and future projected periods. In these two figures, in the future projected periods, the observed series is replaced by an objective series which is computed as the observed series (monthly mean or standard deviation), scaled by the variation between the projected and the historical period of the modeled series. Each projected period is centered in a moving window whose length is equal to the length of the historical period.
